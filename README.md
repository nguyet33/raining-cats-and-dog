## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an application that would be able to save local data and recall the information in an organized manner to allow users look up weather in the desired city. This project was built to practice using Apis along with some JavaScript to produce an ineractive weather website that also keeps track of the date, temperauture, wind, and humidity. The webiste has a present day weather forecast shown along with 5 other days. Data can be store and recall on user local machine. This solves the need of an individual who are looking for weather of other city that they may visit to best plan their trip.
