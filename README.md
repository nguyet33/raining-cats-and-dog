## User Story
```md
AS A traveller
I WANT to see the future weather in the City I am visiting
SO THAT I can best plan my trip.
```
## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an application that would be able to save local data and recall the information in an organized manner to allow users look up weather in the desired city. This project was built to practice using Apis along with some JavaScript to produce an ineractive weather website that also keeps track of the date, temperauture, wind, and humidity. The webiste has a present day weather forecast shown along with 5 other days. Data can be store and recall on user local machine

This solves the need of an individual who are looking for weather of other city that they may visit to best plan their trip. 

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
